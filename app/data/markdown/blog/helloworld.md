## Hello World

----------------------------

This is my first blogpost

Blog on scientific mindset approach and general disclaimer

- Views are my own unless explicitly stated
- I will definitely make mistakes and get some things wrong and am more than willing, in fact, even looking for ways to resolve those.
- Opinions are non-stationary and will be updated as new information comes up
- Probably lots of contradictions and cognitive traps at first but need to practice and start refining thoughts
- Do not intend to take credit for ideas that aren't my own and will do my best to assign credit as needed.
- Everything I have read, see, heard has potentially influenced my opinions as my brain works hard to make sense of all the information coming in and pieces together. If anything, the only thing I can take credit for is putting things together and trying to paint a particular picture -- which is sort of what creativity is and how we all come up with something anyways.
- I want to seek the truth in all aspects and will hope to minimize biases and not "offend" anyone
- Will try my best to appreciate the complexity, do my due diligence and not unduly polarize/simplify matters even if that turns a seemingly simple problem into chaos
