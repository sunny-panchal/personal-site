Project description coming soon

- Argument for giving people the benefit of the doubt
- Everyone being a result of their unique worldline
    - "credit-assignment"
- Identifying the potential and valuing everyone for the amazing network of neurons they are
- Judging "actions" not people
    - We don't separate the two right now
    - What a future where we do that looks like
    - Why is this important and how this fits in with the revelation of a lack of free will
