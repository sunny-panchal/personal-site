Add the drawing from my notebook here.

- thoughts - internal activity
  - could be related to an action that needs to be taken, deliberation of previous actions, mood, perception -- very powerful and can hog all attention (i think i was referring to the visual stimuli here or the strength of internal activity here)

- Talk about the brain being a medium which allows us to access a conscious state.
- Internal activity/thought as spontaneous activity, schemas, attractor states which consume consciousness, block direct signals
  - medium has a certain capacity to bring info to Consciousness
  - Best we can do is direct attention to consciousness itself to identify where experiences are emerging and mitigate internally generated noise
  - We can never access consciousness directly -- only through some medium, some transducer designed to be receptive to certain types of information.

- consciousness aggregates?

- Felt where the information is processed; quantumly entangled? --> agreeable with proportion of information content and its dominance is consciousness.

- the same internal circuitry collecting information from our various senses is where the information is processed and undergoes various modes of operation and various dynamical modes of operation decoupled from direct input which can span temporally and spatially. The circuits can also activate and enter modes of operation spontaneously.
- It's where there decoupled activity takes over larger swaths of the mediums capacity that indirect, internally generated consciousness occurs; which tends to occlude direct perceptions. It's the chaotic neural storms that arise and enter into dynamic uncontrollable activity which suffering emerges from and can lead to a person not maintaining presence.

##### Panpsychism

Listening to a podcast on consciousness and arguments against panpsychism just seem so emotionally charged and chauvinistic. People find it very hard to seperate this need for there being something special with us. People very readily reject ideas that attribute out characteristics to "lesser animals" or to every material object in general. Contrary to this, there's the emergentist theory where at some stage along the way of our evolution consciousness "popped" into ezistence from what's usually argued as a critical density in information complexity. I find this one less plausible as it suggests a dualist interpretation with consciousness existing on a different plane which a sufficiently complex system can pierce into and allow the phenomena to flood in. This still suggests that even at a less complex level, there is some interaction of the physical system with "consciousness." There would still be some defined boundary that exists between the physical and phenomenological realities.

Neither of these theories address the mystery of what consciousness is. They merely try to understand how it fits in with the physical world; with materialism. Even if panpsychism were the true reality, how do the phenomenological experiences exist, why do they exist, why do they feel the way they are? How do they aggregate experience, how do they bind and how do they maintain separation with other beings/concentrations of consciousness?

Can conscious experiences bridge physical space with another individual? When you are in love with someone and feel a really strong connection with them, is there any form of entanglement happening with them?

##### Random  
- What can equations such as the Navier stokes equations for fluid flow teach us about chaotic neural storms and how they ensue?
- Can neural storms be viewed as a sort of turbulence and moments of clarity/being in the present, viewed as laminar, controlled states?
- Order and chaos for concentration
    - Nautilus article: "...turbulent flow contain orderly patterns and forms..."
    - How is turbulence studied/regarded in neuroscience for neural activity?
    - A thought as an eddie that forms and dissipates over time?
    - By directing attention to direct stimuli in meditation, you reduce the propagation of eddies from cascading into larger neural storms.

##### Goals:
1. Develop good predictive model of sensory stimuli
2. Develop a model of self and how actions change environment
3. Develop model of other objects in environment

- First one ultimately contains the latter 2 as they emerge from the stimuli
    - Objects and results of actions don't exist outside of the stimuli being received.

1. Predictive model of sensory stimuli
2. Generative process to make predictions at different temporal scales
3. Attention mechanism to leverage a fixed computational capacity
4. Attractor dynamics
5. Stimuli-absent reverberations
  - where internal thought lies
6. Neocortex-like processing of stimuli
  - Can cause activity in regions responsible for processing stimuli in the absence of the stimuli, or, override the incoming stimuli to settle in imaginative, thoughts, day-dreaming
  - Attention mechanism modulates using regions of the brain to process stimuli vs reverberate due to internally caused butterfly effect

- Build a system that is just trying to make sense of all of the information it is receiving. Give it the ability to choose for itself what is important, the ability to modulate what information it is attending to, and the capacity to store patterns of activity that "make sense" of the world and puts it in more favorable states.

- ***Multi-modal distinct and unified parallel predictions based on reliability of prediction, missing info, reward of outcome, current state***

- Modulate attention based on:
    1. Uncertainty in a modality
    2. Uncertainty in combined modality
    3. Predicted scale of impact from taken action
    4. Internal state of affairs
        - E.g. if you're about to die of starvation, better focus on food

- Need to have the capacity to store knowledge and build on it
    - larger attractor dynamics
    - Outward growing attractor states
    - Capacity of storage and attention can limit size and present activation

- How do you incorporate intention/sensation?
    - just allow analogous behavior to emerge?
    - Should have ability to act in best interest

- With an emergentist, reductionist, mechanistic approach, need:
    1. capacity (memory)
    2. Learning ability
    3. Ability to act
    4. Awareness

- Switching between policies
    - I would imagine a dynamic hierarchical attractor states which is modulated based on environment and internal state and itself modulates a dynamic set of policies
        - Actively constraining and broadening the scope of actions available based on the attractor state.

- Curiosity and sponteneity through chaos/ random departuers from attractor states and action exploration to improve internal model.

- What utility does knowledge serve if not to better the chances of survival and simply improving the prediction models of the agent?

- ***Full credit to my world line of activity; to all the stimuli I have received, to all the spontaneous activity in my mind and to all the knowledge our species has accrued***

- Emboddied cognition in the absence of a high fidelity simulation to embed the agent within seems crucial

##### To work on:

- Hierarchical dynamics, composite attractor networks
- Mutual and siloed multi-modal predictive networks
- Combination of the two above
- Process of improvement of generative model attenuating inputs
- Value-based, goal-based policy which is selected based on outputs of generator model, innate goals and attractor states status.
- Embedding of stimuli/modality into attractor states vs. state mutual embedding
- Its the activity of the attractor states which concern attention.

##### Hypothesis on goal formation

Our ability to formulate goals and execute actions over large temporal scales (not immediately accessible) perhaps lies in our ability to correctly associate vibrations in the air, which we've built an understanding of language with, with a predictive engine over large temporal spans. Eg. The thought of taking a flight next week incorporates a deep understanding of the future stimuli involved in the formation of such a concept. Even "intention" is a learned behavior where volition seeming so personal and free-spirited is just a learned association of incoming stimuli and actions/thoughts to be taken/had to bring about a "favorable" stream of stimuli at a temporally removed point in time.
