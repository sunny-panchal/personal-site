###### Disclaimer:
    My knowledge and understanding of the subjects are a work in progress and may judgements may hence be contradictary
    and/or ill-defined at times. I am keen on identifying gaps in my knowledge and working on bettering my understanding. 
    I've reached a point where I can only theorize on these topics in my head for so long and need to put my thoughts down
    on paper to consolidate and improve my understanding with some feedback.  

#### Intro
    How do you even describe consciousness? Thsi paragraph should really elicit awe about the wonderful
    reality of consciousness and how amazing it is that something like it exists at all. Start introducing
    concepts such as phenomenological experience, qualia, and the hard problem of AI.
    
    
#### Consciousness through the ages
    Here I want to talk about the leading thinkers on consciousness and give an overview of the theories that 
    they had presented which I would then go on in detail below.
    
#### The Hard Problem


#### Is your colour red the same as mine?


#### Attention Schema Theory


#### Integrated Information Theory


#### Inception loops (GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach)


#### Global Workspace Theory


#### Orchestrated OR


#### David Hoffman's Nature of Reality (Computational Account of Consciousness I think?)


#### Is a rock conscious?
    Here I want to talk about consciousness 
    
#### Is it like something to be anything?
    I need to think of a better heading for this but essentially, here I want to talk about it being an intrinsic property
    of the universe for it to be like something to be anything.
    
#### Forced dualism through IIT
    If the commplexity of information processing reaches a critical point after which something becomes self-reflective and 
    conscious, how is this barrier defined and how would this 
    


1. What is the hard problem, where are we in our understanding?
    - establish central tennets - realism, reductionist, materialist, non-dualist

2. From the bottom - panpsychism, orch-or, conscious percepts from or
    - outline emergence fallacy and roadblocks
    - How both increased levels of complexity and "appearance" (the alternative that I'm forgetting right now) both end up supporting dualism - necessity of interaction with the "stuff" of mind

3. Being like something to be receptive to a type of information and to process information in certain ways
    - Colors as sequestering/clustering
    - Pain receptors

4. Lessons from meditation on consciousness
    - consciousness as a prior
    - location of consciousness

5. Requirements of a medium for consciousness and how our medium gives us phenomenological experience

6. Direct stimuli perception vs internally generated activity.

7. Runaway neural storm as "thought"

8. Attention as a way of modulating attractor states -- limited capacity of the networks/limited parallelization of modality-specific activity -- imagination/thought vs raw perception

9. Emotions/mood as an attractor state/bias.

10. Implications for self and relation with others as a concentrations of processing
    - lack of free will
    - we're all in this together
