Add the drawing from my notebook here.

1. What is the hard problem, where are we in our understanding?
    - establish central tennets - realism, reductionist, materialist, non-dualist

2. From the bottom - panpsychism, orch-or, conscious percepts from or
    - outline emergence fallacy and roadblocks
    - How both increased levels of complexity and "appearance" (the alternative that I'm forgetting right now) both end up supporting dualism - necessity of interaction with the "stuff" of mind

3. Being like something to be receptive to a type of information and to process information in certain ways
    - Colors as sequestering/clustering
    - Pain receptors

4. Lessons from meditation on consciousness
    - consciousness as a prior
    - location of consciousness

5. Requirements of a medium for consciousness and how our medium gives us phenomenological experience

6. Direct stimuli perception vs internally generated activity.

7. Runaway neural storm as "thought"

8. Attention as a way of modulating attractor states -- limited capacity of the networks/limited parallelization of modality-specific activity -- imagination/thought vs raw perception

9. Emotions/mood as an attractor state/bias.

10. Implications for self and relation with others as a concentrations of processing
    - lack of free will
    - we're all in this together
