#### Some quotes I admire
- "Trust your intuitions. Either they are good and you will succeed, or they are bad and you'll never get far anyways." - Geoffrey Hinton

- "Life is too short for the indulgence of animosity" - Sir Walter Scott

- “Never attribute to malice what could be attributed to something else” - Hanlan’s Razor

- “The problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the thing that might be worth saying.” — Gilles Deleuze
