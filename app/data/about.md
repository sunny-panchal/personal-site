#### Intro
I am a recent graduate from the MSc in Artificial Intelligence program at the University of Edinburgh where I had enrolled in a diverse selection of courses in computational neuroscience and machine learning. I strongly believe a multi-disciplinary approach to AI is necessary to truly appreciate the complexities of developing AGI and am very excited to continue research in this field.

Research Interests:
  - AI safety/policy/governance
  - Computational neuroscience
  - Predictive coding/active inference
  - Robotics
  - Reinforcement learning
  - AGI/Superintelligence
  - Self-supervised learning

#### Currently
I'm an A.I. Researcher at [Twenty Billion Neurons GmbH](https://20bn.com) helping to usher in an era of in-home virtual personal trainers (and convincing myself to start blogging).

#### In the long run, I'd like to
- Obtain a PhD in a relevant high-impact topic within AI
- Publish an annual review on the state of AGI
- Head my own research department

#### Travel

- I am originally from Brampton (Canada) and have since lived in Toronto (Canada), Edinburgh (UK), and Vlorë (Albania -- if a month counts...).

- I've been to [23](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12Lp3nk-7CLgvIGQzyYfTaBJIMN1kEEER&usp=sharing) countries so far and look forward to growing that list.

- In 2019, I visited: UK, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechia, Netherlands, and Albania.

- In 2018, I started my graduate studies in the UK.


#### Some random tidbits

- I almost always have a pen and journal on me.

- I hate writing about myself.

- I aspire to become a hyperpolyglot (<s>halfway there!</s> I need to practise a few again...).


#### Some things to think about

- How do I know what I know until I see what I say? (Daniel Dennet)

- Why do we experience anything at all?

- Self-improvement and desire/motivation-driven actions on the basis of a lack of free will.


#### Some quotes I admire
- "Trust your intuitions. Either they are good and you will succeed, or they are bad and you'll never get far anyways." - Geoffrey Hinton

- "Life is too short for the indulgence of animosity" - Sir Walter Scott

- “Never attribute to malice what could be attributed to something else” - Hanlan’s Razor

- “The problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the thing that might be worth saying.” — Gilles Deleuze
